# Website Description
This is a front-end React developer task for this website. We call this website Miro. Miro is the visual platform that your team uses to communicate, work together, and create.
This website's frontend design was all I worked on. For this website, I used React.js, Tailwind CSS, HTML, and React hooks to manage the state. This website is responsive on desktop, laptop, and mobile devices.
Netlify was used to deploy this website.
